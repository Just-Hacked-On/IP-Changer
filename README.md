# IP Changer By Just Hacked On

IP Changer by Just Hacked On is a Bash script that automatically changes your public IP address using the Tor network. Itâ€™s built for security researchers, privacy-conscious users, and ethical hackers who want to anonymize their traffic while working online.

It works by sending a signal to the Tor service to switch to a new circuit, giving you a new IP each time without restarting your network or Tor service.
